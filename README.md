# Room-Occupancy-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
The ability to precisely determine localized building occupancy in real-time enables a 
number of compelling applications, including intelligent control of building systems, such as 
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings that consume a significant amount 
of energy, to minimize energy use. Making them demand-driven based on human occupancy is 
one way to make the most of their utilization. This would not only save energy but also improve 
the comfort and health of the residents. This was done by using a low-cost, classification-based 
method that took use of lots of non-intrusive environmental sensors. The Internet of Things (IoT) 
has made sensors that can detect environmental characteristics freely available, and this data 
can be processed using machine learning
Data on occupancy detection was used in a controlled manner using sensor nodes 
that were placed in a room in a star configuration. Measurements were made over a controlled 
period of seven days with the occupancy of the room increasing from 0 (no persons) to 1, 2, and 
3. Even while power savings through detection alone can grow, the system's adaptability and 
efficiency can be improved by knowing the precise number of inhabitants. Therefore, occupancy 
estimate is the primary focus of this dataset.
 This multivariate, time series dataset has 10129 instances and was deployed in a 6 
m 4.6 m room with 16 sensor measurements aggregated over every 30 second using wireless 
transceivers among numerous nodes in the room, all of which were periodically submitting data 
to the sink.
Overview of our dataset: Further, the dataset is divided into training and test set.
